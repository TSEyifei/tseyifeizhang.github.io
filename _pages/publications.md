(2) [Activism Pressure and The Market for Corporate Assets](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3305260), with [Ulrich Hege](https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/ulrich-hege)
<br />
On the program: AFA 2020
<br />
We document that hedge fund activism, as well as its potential threat, could lead firms to be more likely to be acquired and less likely to acquire other firms. We aggregate them to industry-level impacts and study how HFA ultimately reshapes the market for corporate assets, including the prices of selling assets and asset liquidity.

(3) Hedge Fund Activism, Corporate Governance, and Product Market Competition (Available upon Request)
<br />
On the program: NFA 2020
<br />
Hedge fund activism is well-known as bringing value to target shareholders. But which kind of targeted firms benefit the most from HFA? The answer is the firms with initial good governance and in competitive industries. I provide two explanations for the puzzling results: (1) campaign success probability and (2) short-termism.
