I really love travelling, enjoying the "venture" for different culture and local scenery. Especially, I enjoy trips with my parents. 

<br />
The two photos below document the 2018 visit of Tokyo with my parents. Tokyo is the No. 1 place I would like to re-visit!

My parents and I also visted Hong Kong and enjoyed the beauty of the famous Victoria Harbor.

Here comes to the view of sea! Fortunately (and before the Covid), I have been to ASSA/AFA San Diego with my advisor Uli, and I met old friends, Jiakun (now at Renmin U) and Senran (SWUFE) there, along with enjoying beach, sea, and local sea food. How beautiful the great San Diego is!

Last but not least, let me introduce my great friend, Dakang, who is a great theoriest at TSE. He comes from Hunan, China, and graduates from UIBE. Click [here](https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/dakang-huang) to browse his photo.
