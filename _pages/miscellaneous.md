I really love travelling a lot, meeting different people and enjoying different culture. I really love travelling with my parents. 

I visited Tokyo with my parents in 2018. Tokyo is the No. 1 place I would like to re-visit! Yes, below are my parents and I (really loving them).

My parents and I also visted Hong Kong and enjoyed the beauty of the Victoria Harbor.

I have been to ASSA/AFA San Diego with my advisor Uli, and surprisingly met old friends, Jiakung (now at Remin U) and Senran (SWUFE). How beautiful San Diego is!
