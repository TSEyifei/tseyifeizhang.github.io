I love traveling, enjoying the "venture" for different cultures and local scenery. Especially, I enjoy "self-planned" trips with my parents. 

<br />
The two photos below document the 2018 visit of Tokyo with my parents. Tokyo is obviously the No. 1 place I would like to revisit! A magic combination of modern and ancient elements.

We also visited Hong Kong, being able to enjoy the beauty of the famous Victoria Harbor, especially in the night, imaging taking the sightseeing ferry...

:) Here comes the view of the sea! Fortunately enough (as it is right before the Covid), I have been to ASSA/AFA San Diego with my advisor Uli. I met with my old friends there, Jiakun (now at Renmin U.), Yuting (U. New Mexico), and Senran (SWUFE) :), along with enjoying beach, sea, and local seafood. How beautiful the great San Diego is!
