I really love travelling a lot, meeting different people and enjoying different culture. I really love travelling with my parents. 

I visited Tokyo with my parents in 2018. Tokyo is the No. 1 place I would like to re-visit!

My parents and I also visted Hong Kong and enjoyed the beauty of the Victoria Harbor. 

I have been to ASSA/AFA San Diego with my advisor Uli, and surprisingly met old friends, Jiakung (now at Remin U) and Senran (SWUFE). How beautiful San Diego is!

Last but not least, let me introduce my great friend, Dakang, who is a great theoriest at TSE. Click here to see his profile.
