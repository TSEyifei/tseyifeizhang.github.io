Hi, I am Yifei Zhang, a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), and my Ph.D. advisor is Professor Ulrich Hege. 

I am currently on the job market in both ASSA 2022 (Boston) and European Job Market 2021 (Barcelona). 

My main research interests lie in empirical corporate finance, economics of innovation, and entrepreneurial finance. 

My single-authored job market paper is about Corporate Venture Capital and Firm Scope, and I will present it in the AFA 2022 regular program (during the ASSA 2022).
